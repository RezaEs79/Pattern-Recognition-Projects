# Pattern Recognition Course Projects

Welcome to the Pattern Recognition course projects repository. This repository contains several projects, each focusing on different aspects of pattern recognition techniques. Below is an overview of the projects and their respective topics:

## Computer_Assignment1: Bayesian

This folder is dedicated to the implementation and exploration of Bayesian methods in the context of pattern recognition. Feel free to explore the contents to gain insights into Bayesian approaches and their applications.

## Computer_Assignment2: MMD and K-NN Classifier with Leave-one-out Method

In this folder, you will find projects related to the Minimum Mahalanobis Distance (MMD) and K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) Classifier, with a specific emphasis on the Leave-one-out method for evaluation.

## Computer_Assignment3: Perceptron Algorithm and Least Squares (LS) Criterion Algorithm

Explore this folder to delve into projects centered around the Perceptron algorithm and the Least Squares (LS) criterion algorithm. Additionally, you'll find implementations of the multi-category generalization of Logistic Discrimination.

## Computer_Assignment4: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) ANN with Back Propagation (BP) Algorithm

This folder is dedicated to projects related to Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), with a focus on training using the Back Propagation (BP) algorithm.

## Final_Project: Comparison of Classifiers with Feature Reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

In this folder, you will find projects that involve the comparison of various classifiers, coupled with feature reduction techniques using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Explore and analyze the results to understand the impact of feature reduction on classifier performance.

Feel free to navigate into each folder to find detailed documentation, source code, and any additional resources related to each project. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy coding!
